      <h1 class="title">Responsive Redesign 	&#127775</h1>
      <p class="overview">For this project, I chose to redesign the website of my favorite local coffee shop at home. I first analyzed
        the usability of the website, specifically the home page, and proceded to make changes of the design.

      <h2>Identifying Usability Problems</h2>
      <p>In order to determine the usability of the website, I focused on four categories: 
        usability, learnability, memorability, and efficiency.</p>
      <div class="usabilityDiv">
        <h3>Usability</h3>
        <p class="usabilityText">The website was hard to navigate due to the inconsistent font sizes, 
          contrast errors, and length of the page. While a one page website is 
          faster to render, the sizes of each section were larger than the content 
          provided, and part of that was due to the irregular font sizes (either 
          huge or super small). Some sections were also unnecessary and distracted 
          from the major points and information of the website, which was distracting 
          and caused the page to be longer than expected. The sections where the font 
          is super small, such as the drink menu and the values sections are additionally 
          hard to read due to the font choice and how the letter-spacing is very compact. 
          The order of the layout is also a bit confusing and the flow of the read seems 
          very rigid. For example, the different menus are split up by a different section
          about vendors. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="usabilityFlex">
      <div class="learnability">
        <h3>Learnability</h3>
        <p class="learnabilityText">While the overall layout of this website makes 
          usability difficult, a user would still be able to learn how to use the 
          website as the purpose of the website is mainly informational. There is 
          little interaction for the user to do (at most watching a video of going 
          to a new page), and the links are clearly formatted as a button. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="memorability">
        <h3>Memorability</h3>
        <p class="memorabilityText">Similar to learnability, a user would be able 
          to easily memorize how to use this website. The nav bar is in the 
          traditional spot and the links are clearly marked. However, a user may 
          have a difficult time remembering the order of the sections, making it 
          difficult to navigate and find information on the page. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="efficiency">
        <h3>Efficiency</h3>
        <p class="efficiencyText">The efficiency of the page is not ideal in that
          there are many sections that are not essential or practical to have on 
          the home page and that could be linked to separate pages. Due to this, 
          the user needs to scroll for a while to reach the end of the page.
        </p>
      </div>
      </div>  
    </section>
    <section class="accessability">
      <h2>Accessability</h2>
      <p class="accessabilityText">When inputting Anthem's website in WAVE, 
        there were 66 contrast errors and 76 other alerts refering to empty buttons,
        redundant buttons, etc. As stated above, Anthem's small and white text over a background 
        image is often hard to read especially with someone with visual impairments. 
        When doing the screenread test, many of their images lacked alt text, so, again,
        someone with visual impairments would have a very difficult time navigatign the website.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="lofi">
      <h2>Lo-Fi Prototypes</h2>
      <p>After analyzing the overall usability of the website, I began to redesign
        the website. I first started by sketching a lofi prototype to determine the 
        new layout and structure of the page. 
      </p>
      <div class="lofiPrototypes">
        <img class="desktoplo" alt="desktop" src="images/desktopLofi.png">
        <img class="tabletlo" alt="tablet" src="images/TabletLofi2.png">
        <img class="phonelo" alt="desktop" src="images/phonelofi2.png">
      </div>
      <ol>
        <li>Change hero section to be shorter so it fits on the screen without scrolling. 
          Make font and text visible when page loads instead of scrolling. 
        </li>
        <li>Change section with mission and values to "Who we are section". 
          Create a link for users to read more about their values. This section is 
          shorter and more compact so the user gets essential information
        </li>
        <li>
          Make font larger and change font to a more legible font. Make background image
          darker so the text pops out more and is easier to read. Decrease number of 
          drinks listed to make the section shorter and have a link to a full menu instead.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make the whole vendor section visible on one screen without scrolling. 
          Make graphic smaller and font smaller so that it all fits in one section.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make location images smaller so that more fit in the space given. making
          a grid allows for more utility of space. 
        </li>
      </ol>
    </section>
    <section class="hifi">
      <h2>Hi-Fi Prototypes</h2>
      <p>After creating Lo-Fi prototypes, I used Figma to create Hi-Fi prototypes 
        to create a design that will look just like the final product. I imported photos
        and created more stylistic buttons/links to make the prototype look more 
        finished.
      </p>
      <div class="hifiPrototypes">
        <img class="desktophi" alt="desktop" src="images/Group 6.png">
        <img class="tablethi" alt="tablet" src="images/Group 7.png">
        <img class="phonehi" alt="desktop" src="images/Group 8.png">
      </div>
      <ol>
        <li>Create a linear gradient (to right) on the background image to make text pop.
        </li>
        <li>Create a grid for the drink and descriptions. Center in the middle. 
          Button opacity in this section is between 0.8-1. When button is hovered, 
          opacity is decreased. 
        </li>
        <li>Create linear gradient(to right) to make text pop.</li>
        <li>Create a grid for locations. Use repeat(4, 1fr) so it is easy to 
          change when making page responsive. When hovering over grid item, scale by 1.05
          so user knows it is a link.
        </li>
        <li>Make hero title and subtitle centered to accomodate for different screen size. 
        </li>
        <li>change flex-direction to column-reverse to accomodate for different screen size.
          Red button gets a shade darker when hovered.
        </li>
        <li>Change grid to have 2 columns instead of 3. Move items to left since most
          users scan the page in an F shape. Buttons still have less opacity when hovered/held down for tablet.
        </li>
        <li>Change flex direction for both container and buttons to make everything stacked to accomodate
          for different screen size. Buttons the same as in "Who We Are" section. 
        </li>
        <li>Change number of columns to 2 on grid. Make the grid 4x2 instead of 2x4</li>
        <li>Make grid have one column and align to left to account for F shape scanning</li>
        <li>Move title and button to center of screen to make it looked more balanced for 
          this screen size. 
        </li>
        <li>Make number of columns on grid 1 to account for small screen. </li>
      </ol>
    </section>
    <section class="styleguide">
      <h2>Visual Style Guide</h2>
      <p>Below is the visual style guide for my redesigned page. There are some interactive components
        and the buttons are reused throughout the page. 
      </p>

    <section class="finalProduct">
      <h2>Redesigned Website</h2>
      <p>In this project, I learned the value of lo-fi and hi-fi prototyping and how 
        those prototypes translates into the final product. The progression from Lo-fi prototypes to 
        the final product was smooth and made coding the webpage much easier. I also learned 
        more about responsive design and the effectiveness of changing the layout to be responsive
        to different screen sizes. In the end, I uploaded my newly designed page back into WAVE and examined the results. 
        Instead of 66 contrast errors, there are now 0, and now only 5 alerts compared to 76. Those 5 alerts refer to
        empty links due to pages not existing as this redesign only pertained to the home page.
